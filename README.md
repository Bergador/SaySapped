# SaySapped

WoW vanilla addon (1.12.1) that makes your character say "Sapped!" when you have been sapped.

This is a backport of the client version 2.4.3 (and up) addon by bitbyte with the same name.

If you wish to change the message or the channel, simply edit the first two lines of the SaySapped.lua file to your liking.
